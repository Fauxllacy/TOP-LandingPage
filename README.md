- This project helped in my understanding of HTML and CSS setup.
- HTML experience gained for this project: Building on top of my understanding of the HTML boiler plate, proper use of divs and associated classes, using ID tags, using containers and section order placements.
- CSS experience gained from this project: Using and applying variable tags and curating a personalized style sheet, understanding and interchanging flexbox properties, importing unique fonts via Google Fonts and styling the HTML sections including the header and footer.
